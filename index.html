<p>
I am a quantitative ecologist who uses mathematical and statistical tools, coupled with experiments and field observations, to solve problems in ecology, conservation, sustainability, and ecosystem management. I am currently a Research Associate in the Department of Biology at the <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/">University of Vermont</a>.  I am the instructor for <a href="https://eastonwhite.github.io/QuantReasoning/">Foundations of Quantitative Reasoning</a>, a PhD course at the University of Vermont. The class is a mix of ecology, evolution, quantitative skills, and programming in R. In my role at UVM, I am also on the <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/quest/leadership-team">leadership team</a> for a NSF-funded PhD traineeship focused on quantitative skills, interdisiplinary work, as well as diversity and inclusion.</p>

<p>I currently conduct research on assessing the effectiveness of protected area networks, improving species monitoring programs, and modeling <a href="https://eastonwhite.github.io/research/#SES">socio-ecological systems in the context of fisheries</a>. My work centers on how environmental variability (e.g. El Ni√±o) affects ecosystems and those that depend on them. My current work is funded through a NSF grant focused on interdisiplinary approaches to study coupled natural-human systems with Madagascar fisheries as a case study:</p>
