<h2>JOIN THE LAB</h2>

<h3><i>Masters students</i></h3>
<p>I am currently looking to recruit a masters student to work on socio-ecological questions in small-scale tropical fisheries. Experience (and willingness to learn more) with R, quantitative skills, and field work is needed. If you are interested, please send an email and CV to Easton White (<a href="mailto:Easton.White@uvm.edu">Easton.White@uvm.edu</a>).</p>
<h3><i>Postdoctoral fellows</i></h3>
<p>I am currently looking to recruit a postdoctoral researcher through the SESYNC postdoctoral fellow program (<a href="https://www.sesync.org/opportunities/research-fellowships-postdoctoral-fellowships/socio-environmental-immersion-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See here for details</a>). This means the postdoc would be based in Annapolis, Maryland. Possible projects include: modeling disturbances and socio-environmental systems, improving monitoring and data collection for understanding socio-environmental questions, infectious diseases in a socio-environmental context, and synthesizing across socio-environmental fisheries. My background is in quantitative ecology with an emphasis on marine systems. However, my interests are broad and I am happy to discuss other project ideas further.<br />
If you are interested, please send an email and CV to Easton White (<a href="mailto:Easton.White@uvm.edu">Easton.White@uvm.edu</a>). The proposals for funding are due in November.</p>
