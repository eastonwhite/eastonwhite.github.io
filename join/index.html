<h2>JOIN THE LAB</h2>

<h3><i>Masters students</i></h3>
<p>I am currently looking to recruit a masters student to work on socio-ecological questions in small-scale tropical fisheries. Experience (and willingness to learn more) with R, quantitative skills, and field work is needed. If you are interested, please send (<a href="mailto:Easton.White@uvm.edu">Easton.White@uvm.edu</a>) a CV and brief introduction, including details of your prior research experience, as well as your research interests and graduate school goals and how you think these align with my research program.</p>


<h3><i>Postdoctoral fellows</i></h3>
<p>I may have funds for a postdoctoral fellow to work on questions related to fisheries and disturbances in the next 1-2 years. In the meantime, I am open to collaboratively working on proposals to help fund independent postdoctoral fellow positions through several different programs. Possible projects include: modeling disturbances and socio-environmental systems, improving population monitoring and data collection, infectious diseases in a socio-environmental context, and synthesizing across socio-environmental fisheries. My background is in quantitative ecology with an emphasis on marine systems. However, my interests are broad and I am happy to discuss other project ideas further.</p>
