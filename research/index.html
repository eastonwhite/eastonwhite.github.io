<p>I use a variety of quantitative approaches, combined with experiments and field observations, to address questions in ecology and conservation science. Most of this work falls within regions of the venn diagram above. I have current projects focused on socio-ecological systems, environmental variabilty and population dynamics, improving monitoring programs, and designing marine reserve networks. In addition to biology-focused work, I have also conducted <a href="#SoTL">research on pedagogy</a>.</p>

<h2>Marine protected areas in a changing world</h2>
<p>We are examining the design of marine protected areas given environmental variability. All over the world, networks of marine protected areas have been established as both a conservation and management tool (Gaines et al. 2010). However, most work to date has ignored the role that variability or uncertainty in designing these marine protected areas (but see Halpern et al. 2006). Variability is important as individual protected areas can serve as an insurance policy for one another. If a population in a particular protected area is devastated by a hurricane, then organisms from another, unaffected population can recolonize that protected area. My current work (available as a preprint below) has focused on building simple, theoretical models to include variability in the design of these protected areas.</p>

<h2>Socio-ecological systems</h2>
<p>Our work on marine protected areas led to an interdisciplinary collaboration with Drs. <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/es/faculty/node/480378" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Merrill Baker-Medard</a> (social scientist at Middlebury College) and <a href="https://marine.unh.edu/faculty-member/elizabeth-fairchild" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth Fairchild</a> (fisheries biologist at the University of New Hampshire). Our goal is to develop tools to make better decisions in highly variable Malagasy fisheries. We take a holistic approach to study the entire socio-ecological system——examining interactions between ecosystem health, poverty, and human health. This project was recently funded by the National Science Foundation Coupled Natural-Human Systems program:</p>

<h2>Improving monitoring for species conservation and management</h2>
<p>Monitoring of populations is a critical aspect of making decisions about the management of species. However, monitoring is often expensive and requires a lot of people-hours. Therefore, it is essential to determine the optimal locations for monitoring, the number of samples to take, and the frequency and duration of monitoring effort.</p>

<p>In a recent manuscript at <em>Bioscience</em> (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biy144/5195956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available here</a>), I determined the minimum number of years required to be confident (i.e. have enough statistical power) in a population trend. Using simulations and empirical data from 822 populations, I estimated that 15.9 years on average were required. There was, however, tremendous variation between populations, casting doubt on simple rules of thumb. In a <a href="http://bioscienceaibs.libsyn.com/saving-species-with-better-monitoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BioScience podcast</a>, I discuss this work and population monitoring in general.</p>

<p>Dr. Steven Heard (University of New Brunswick), Dr. Auriel Fournier (Mississippi State University), and I recently published an article in <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cobi.13371" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conservation Biology that focused on the question of sampling bias in monitoring programs.</a>. We found that bias in the sites chosen for monitoring can lead to overestimates in the long-term population decline estimates.


<p><a name="management_variability"></a></p>
<h2>Variability in ecological management outcomes</h2>

From invasive species to fisheries, managers are always trying to determine which management strategies are most effective. However, this is often a difficult challenge. If a particular management strategy fails, was it because it was a bad strategy or because of bad luck? It is difficult to disentangle management effectiveness from luck in the field because we often only have a single observation of the system. 

We have built a series of mathematical models (specifically a set of stochastic discrete-time equations that include stage-structure) to show there can be large variability in management outcomes. We studied this in the context of controlling the spread of an invasive species. We tested these ideas using laboratory experiments with the flour beetle (Tribolium spp.). The experiments matched up with predictions from the mathematical models. Although the laboratory experiments were highly controlled, there was still large variability in management outcomes (see movie of time series below). This highlights the importance of carefully evaluating management successes and failures in nature. We are now building on this work to study how to make invasive species management both effective and also cost effective.

<h2>Long-term population trends of sharks and rays</h2>
<p>Worldwide, many species of sharks and rays have seen large declines in population size. Approximently, 25% of all chondrichthyan (shark, ray, chimaeras) species around the world are threatened according to IUCN criteria (Dulvy 2014). These species are threatened from overfishing, habitat degradation and pollution. Sharks and rays act as predators and drive population dynamics of species lower in the food chain. (Heithaus et al. 2010). In response to declining populations of sharks and rays, many countries have instituted marine protected areas (MPA). An MPA is a conservation and management tool that is designed to let species recover by providing them with an area of refuge, free from fishing. However, it is not clear if MPAs are effective for large mobile predators, like sharks and rays.</p>
<p>We are studying sharks and rays at Cocos Island. The island is located 550km off of the mainland of Costa Rica. The island has been a marine protected area for the past two decades. We use data collected by the dive company <a href="http://www.underseahunter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Undersea Hunter</a>, to get a sense of the population status of 12 shark and ray species that are commonly seen at Cocos Island. Here is the paper <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12478/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shifting elasmobranch community assemblage at Cocos Island &#8211; an isolated marine protected area</a> and here is a corresponding <a href="http://communications.uvic.ca/releases/release.php?display=release&amp;id=1456" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a>.</p>

<h4>Shark nurseries in the Bahamas</h4>
<p style="text-align:left;">In a related project, I studied long-term trends of lemon sharks found in the Bahamas. We developed a series of mathematical models to better understand the population of juvenile lemon sharks found in the lagoons of <a href="http://www.biminisharklab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bimini</a>. We found that the variance in population size of juvenile sharks, is mostly driven by the environment. Therefore, predators and food resources may not be as important factors in driving population dynamics as once thought. I combined a mathematical model with field data to better understand a population of lemon sharks in the Bahamas. I found that a simple model could predict the long-term mean of the population size well, but it did a poor job at predicting the variance in population size <a href="https://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6150-9-23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(White et al. 2014)</a>. It turned out that much of the variance in population size could be explained by a few unusual years in terms of the environment.</p>

<h2>Metapopulations dynamics of small mammals</h2>
<p>We study the ecology and evolution of the American pika (<em>Ochotona princeps</em>) living on a metapopulation at Bodie State Historic Park. The metapopulation is comprised of patches made up of abandoned ore dumps. Near the end of the 19th century, pikas colonized these ore dumps creating a metapopulation of about 80 patches. Around 1990, the southern half of the study site had collapsed and few pikas have been censused there since. We developed a simulation model to better understand the dynamics of the Bodie population. We have found that spatial structure (the arrangement of the patches in the landscape) and demographic stochasticity both important aspects of the Bodie site.</p>
<p>These findings have recently been published in <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.2546" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ecology</em></a>.</p>
<p>Here is a simulation of metapopulation dynamics at Bodie over the last 40 years. The size of the circles represents how many pikas are on a given patch in each year.</p>

<p>I spent a summer at the <a href="http://www.iiasa.ac.at/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis</a> in Vienna, Austria. I led a team of biologists and mathematicians to investigate the evolutionary consequences of changing seasonal regimes due to climate change. This work focused on the collared pika (Ochotona collaris) found in the Yukon, Canada. This work is available as a <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/27435/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preprint (White et al. 2018).</a></p>

<h2>Scholarship of Teaching and Learning</h2>
<p>In addition to biology-focused work, I have also been engaged in research on pedagogy. This is often termed Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) or sometimes Discipline-based education research (DBER). As a scientist, I view teaching as a highly scientific process. I design and implement experiments in the classroom each time I teach. I then examine the results using various assessments (e.g. pre- and post-assessments, clicker questions, online activities) and refine my teaching approach.</p>
<p>As part of my efforts in teaching a summer biology bridge program at UC Davis, I also assessed student outcomes. These results are being used by the department to improve the biology bridge program in the future.</p>
<p>I am also part of the <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/quest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuEST</a> Leadership Team at the University of Vermont. QuEST is a PhD training grant focused on quantitative skills, applied problem solving, and diversity. Part of my responsibility is to assess student learning in the core course titled, Foundations of Quantitative Reasoning. The course involves inquiry- and team-based activities as well as active learning.</p>
