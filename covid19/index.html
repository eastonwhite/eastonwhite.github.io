<h2>COVID-19 Tracking</h2>

This page will track daily state-level differences in the COVID-19 dynamics for the United States. All the data used here comes from <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">John Hopkins University and the CDC </a>. We are now trying to determine what is causing the differing state-level trajectories. Please let me know if you are interested in contributing to this project. A preprint and R code are available at https://github.com/eastonwhite/COVID19_US_States.

  <figcaption>Fig 1: (left panel) Total number of COVID-19 cases for the US over time. (right panel) Total log number of COVID-19 cases for the US over time. The red, dashed line indicates the best fit curve. A straight line on a log graph indicates exponential growth. Therefore, the US started seeing exponential growth in cases after March 1st.</figcaption>
